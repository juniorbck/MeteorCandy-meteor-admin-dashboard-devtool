# Package Support

Every Account package has a slight difference, and its important that we can support these differences. This is why Meteor Candy scans through your package list and tries to determine what things to look for. 

Meteor Candy supports all the vendor-provided Accounts packages. However, if you are using a third-partys account package, Meteor Candy exposes the settings for you to plug it right in.
