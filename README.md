# Welcome to Meteor Candy

Meteor Candy is an admin panel for Meteor.js. It contains support for account management, custom functions, report viewing, tables, and settings. Meteor Candy works as a set of three packages: view, core, and config. The first two are to be used as-is, while the third one allows you to plot in your requirements.

## Compared to yogiben:meteor-admin and related forks

Meteor Candy takes a new and modern approach to building admin panels. First, it uses carefully scoped code and dynamic imports to ensure that no burden is added to your client. Second, it only uses methods to retrieve data, and does so in a scalable and high performance way. Finally, it's all about your configuration, rather than being about plug and play.

## License

Meteor Candy is a proprietary product with a custom license. It's free to use in development, but requires a paid license to be used in production.
