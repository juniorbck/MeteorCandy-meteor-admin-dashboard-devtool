# Welcome to Meteor Candy

Meteor Candy is an admin panel for Meteor.js. It contains support for account management, custom functions, report viewing, tables, and settings. Meteor Candy works as a set of three packages: view, core, and config. The first two are to be used as-is, while the third one allows you to plot in your requirements.
